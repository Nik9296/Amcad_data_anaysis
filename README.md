# AMCAD_DATA_ANALYASIS

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing salary and career decisions for engineering graduates. The analysis was conducted using various statistical techniques to identify trends and outliers, with a particular focus on the connections between gender, specialization, and salary expectations.

## Introduction
The AMCAD Data Analysis project aims to understand the factors influencing salary expectations and career decisions among engineering graduates. The study emphasizes the impact of gender and specialization on salary expectations, shedding light on critical variations and trends within the dataset.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** To identify key factors influencing salary and career decisions among engineering graduates.
- **Scope:** Analysis of gender and specialization-related trends and their impact on salary expectations.

## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project includes information on engineering graduates, including their gender, specialization, and salary expectations. The data was collected from various sources to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

- **Dataset:** The CSV file `ameo dataset.csv` contains all the necessary data for this analysis.

## Data Analysis
Statistical analysis techniques were applied to the dataset to identify trends, outliers, and significant connections between different variables. The analysis was performed using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Key Findings
- **Gender-Specialization Connection:** The analysis highlighted significant connections between gender and specialization, with certain specializations showing distinct gender preferences.
- **Salary Expectations:** There were notable variations in salary expectations based on gender and specialization, with some groups expecting higher salaries than others.

## Reports
A detailed report on the key findings and insights from this analysis has been documented in a PowerPoint presentation. The PPT file `AMCAD insights Report.pptx` contains visualizations, charts, and a comprehensive summary of the analysis.

## Conclusion
The AMCAD Data Analysis project provides valuable insights into the factors that influence salary expectations and career decisions among engineering graduates. The findings can be used to inform policy decisions, career counseling, and further research in the field.
